# Weather Prediction App

I met someone at a party who told me about their genius idea and it seemed like a fun day project. 

A simple web app built with React and Flask to predict tomorrow's weather using cutting edge AI innovating technology :^).

for this use case i know the backend is unnecessary but its a tech PoC for best practices.
